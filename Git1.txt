Git known as version control system. 

Free, Open source and distributed.

Version control is a software that track and manage changes to files over time.


GIT - it is a version control software that runs locally on your machine.
GITHUB - it is a sevice that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collabrate with other people.

Git was created as command-line-tool. To use it, we run various git commands in a unix shell.(not so user friendly).

git status - gives information on the current status of a git repoitory and its contents.


git init - will intialize git repository in folder of choice to be tracked.


git add <file|folder> Pick changes to go into next commit
git add file - Pick individual file
git add folder/ - Pick all files inside a folder (and subfolders)
git add . - Pick all files (in folder command line is running in)
git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory if you made changes in file thats already added to staging area.


git rm --cached <file> -  to unstage that was added but not commited


git commit will actually commit changes from the staging area
git commit -m "message" - Creates a commit with a message attached
git commit -m "message" --amend - Update previous commit instead of creating new one.


git log View the commit history
git log --all - Show all commits (not just current branch)
git log --all --graph - Show branching visually in the command line

.gitignore - Tell git which files/folders it SHOULD NOT track.
The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:

    Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.

    Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.

    You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.

    You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.

    You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).


git diff - git diff shows you the exact lines added and removed — the patch but not yet staged
git diff --staged - to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit

rm -rf .git -  Remove git from project
